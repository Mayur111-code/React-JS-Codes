# folder structure :

📁 React Folder Structure (Create React App)
When you run:

npx create-react-app myapp
It creates a complete React project setup with the following default structure:

📂 myapp/ (Root Folder)
The main project folder containing everything related to your React app.

1. 📁 node_modules/
Contains all installed npm packages like React, Bootstrap, etc.

Automatically generated when you run npm install.

Do not edit manually.

2. 📁 public/
Static files that are served directly to the browser. These files are not processed by Webpack.

Important Files:

index.html – Main HTML file, contains <div id="root">. React mounts here.

favicon.ico – Icon shown in the browser tab.

manifest.json – Supports PWA (Progressive Web App) features.

robots.txt – Used by search engines (SEO).

3. 📁 src/
This is where all the React code (components, logic, styles) lives.

Important Files:

index.js – Entry point of the app. Renders <App /> into the DOM.

App.js – Main component. Usually your starting UI code.

App.css – Styling for the App component.

index.css – Global CSS styles.

logo.svg – Default React logo (can be deleted).

reportWebVitals.js – Optional performance monitoring.

setupTests.js – Used for unit testing setup (Jest).

4. 📄 Root-Level Files
package.json – Contains project info, dependencies, and scripts.

package-lock.json – Locks the exact version of installed packages.

.gitignore – Lists files/folders Git should ignore.

README.md – Project description and usage instructions.

📁 Optional Folders You Can Add in src/
As your app grows, organize your code better:

Folder	Purpose
/components	Reusable UI elements like buttons/cards
/pages	Page-level components (Home, About, etc.)
/assets	Images, icons, and other media
/styles	Global or modular CSS/SCSS files
/hooks	Custom React hooks
/utils	Helper functions or constants
/services	API services (Axios calls, etc.)

#  MVC – Model View Controller :



✅ What is MVC?
MVC stands for Model – View – Controller.
It is a software architecture pattern used to separate the application into three interconnected parts to organize code better.

🧠 Purpose of MVC:
Clean and organized structure.

Separates business logic, user interface, and input control.

Makes applications easier to maintain, test, and scale.

🔧 1. Model (M)
Manages data, business logic, and rules of the application.

Communicates with the database or API.

Does not handle UI or user input.

Example:
In a blog app, the model might be Post, which handles data like title, content, and date.

🎨 2. View (V)
The UI (User Interface) of the application.

Displays data from the Model to the user.

It’s concerned only with presentation — no logic or data fetching.

Example:
HTML page or React component that shows blog posts.

🧭 3. Controller (C)
Handles user input and controls the flow of the application.

Connects the Model and the View.

Takes input from the user → updates the Model → refreshes the View.

Example:
When a user clicks "Submit Post", the controller validates and sends the data to the Model, then updates the UI.

📊 Summary Table
Component	Responsibility
Model	Handles data and business logic
View	Shows data to the user (UI)
Controller	Handles user input and app flow

📌 MVC in Real Projects:
Framework	Uses MVC?
Express.js (Node.js)	✅ Yes
Django (Python)	✅ Yes
Laravel (PHP)	✅ Yes
ASP.NET (C#)	✅ Yes
React	❌ Not pure MVC, but can follow similar structure with components (View), state (Model), and event handlers (Controller-like logic)




# interview quations :
Q 1 what is fragment :-


// or - React.Fragment-
// Modern Feature
//  is a wrapper / container which is used to grouping our JSX Code



# css in jsx :

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ color: 'blue', backgroundColor: 'lightgray', padding: '20px' }}>
      Hello, JSX Inline Style!
    </div>
  );
}




# what is componat in react :-

# syntax: 


const App=()=>{
        
        return(
                <>

                </>
        )
}
export default App;







# state and props :

# state: state is data managed inside a component that can change over time.

# props : props are data passed from a parent component to child component.

# state : mutable :- can be changed using setState(class) or state setter function(useState).

# props : inmmutable :- Cannont be changed by the child component.

# state : Inside the component itself.

# props : Outside the component, in the parent component.

# state : the component itself (or hooks).

# props : The parent component Updates the props it passes.

# state : for storing local, dynamic data  of the component. 

# props : for passing data and configuration to child components.

# state : [ex] const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

# props : [ex] <Child name="Mayur" />

# state : Used for that specific component only.

# props : Helps make components reusable by passing different props.
